# Academic League Stat Tracker

Created to allow for online tracking of quiz bowl games for my team. Tracks question categories, individual players, tossup points, and time played.
Normal users are able to download game reports after tracking. These can be loaded again at any time to view an analysis.
Custom functionality is implemented for my own use that allows me to save games to the cloud. AWS Dynamodb and Lambda are used for this.
